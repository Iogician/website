<h1>Jaden Hernandez's Project Portfolio</h1>
<p>Many of the skills I've gained, including Siemens NX, Autodesk Inventor Professional, 
   MATLAB, Simulink, XFLR5, Python, C, and Aras Innovator were acquired through coursework, but were also applied and honed
   during projects I've worked on.<br>
   Below is a list of the most significant projects I have been apart of:

<h1>Introduction to Aerospace Design: Mars Sample Retrieval (September - December 2023)</h1>
<img src="teamr403.jpg" alt="Northrop Grumman Space Award 2024 Presentation" class="image-right" width="320" height="213">
<p>as part of Purdue University's Introduction to Aerospace Design course, (course code "AAE 25100") me and a group of three other students
   were tasked with designing a Mars sample retrieval mission involving selecting a viable launch vehicle and launch date
   while also calculating important astrodynamic mission parameters such as Î”V, mission duration, and stage masses.<br><br>
   during this project,
   I was largely in charge of writing all of these calculations in MATLAB and then communicating their mathematical basis in our

   me and my teammates' efforts won us the

   for having the most clearly communicated rocket design among all students in the Introduction to Aerospace Design course.
