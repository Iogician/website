        <p><small>Status: In Progress</small><br>
           A custom solid rocket motor utilizing a three-point star port geometry is currently being mixed and prepared at Maurice J. Zucrow Laboratories for use in a model rocket
           that will launch in mid-November 2025 and allow us to validate the accuracy of our ballistics and trajectory simulations. The grain geometry, chosen for its high volume loading,
           was designed in SolidWorks and is estimated to be 4.6" x 1.212" in length and diameter respectively. From ballistics simulations, this H91 class motor is expected to produce
           around 258.70 Ns of impulse for a burn time of 2.79 seconds while still providing a 1.390 safety factor for maximum chamber pressure.

        <h3>September 2025 - </h3>
        <p><small>Status: In Progress</small><br>
           Under the advising of Dr. Nak-seung Patrick Hyun and alongside Jeffery Zhou and Gilbert Chang, a gliding-enabled, mode-switching, unmanned sensing (GEMUS) flapping wing vehicle 
           is being developed as a control system development platform to better understand how birds with large wings are able to conserve energy when faced with wind disturbances.
           The preliminary design has been partially validated through force transducer tests, with wind tunnel tests upcoming for further validation.

        <h3>April 2025</h3>
        <p><small>Status: Completed | Deliverables available!</small><br>As the final experiment for the Aerodynamics Laboratory (AAE 33401) course, a custom experiment was developed that would test the aerodynamic performance
        of flexible, finite wings in a wind tunnel. More specifically, these wings would be additively manufactured with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and
        would have varying levels of stiffness. When faced with high freestream velocities, the most flexible wings yielded surprising aerodynamic and structural behaviors.</p></div>

         In collaboration with Anish Agarwal, Shreesh Nalatwad, Noah Smith, and Will Stupart, a MATLAB interface was developed to estimate
        heating characteristics from forced convection and conduction for a simulated sounding rocket. Users are also able
        to approximate insulation thickness needed to protect avionics and other internals. By leveraging lumped system analysis,
        simulation time is reduced by over 90% compared to Ansys Fluent while only yielding ~10% error, making this a valuable tool for
        early rocket design iterations.</p></div>
