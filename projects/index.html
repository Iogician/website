<h1>Jaden Hernandez's Project Portfolio</h1>
<p>Many of the skills I've gained, including SolidWorks, Siemens NX, Autodesk Inventor Professional, Ansys Fluent, 
   MATLAB, Simulink, XFLR5, Python, C, and Aras Innovator were acquired through coursework, but were also applied and honed
   during projects I've worked on.<br>
   Below is a list of the most significant projects I have been apart of:

        <h3>February 2025 - Present</h3>
        <p>Under the advising of Dr. Nak-seung Patrick Hyun and in collaboration with Andrew Hadikusumo and Darin Tsai, 
         a biomimetic translational ornithopter robot is currently in development while Ptera Software's unsteady vortex lattice method is utilized to
        determine aerodynamic characteristics of the wing-flapping motion based on varying linkage lengths and ranges of motion.</p></div>

        <h3>January 2025 - Present</h3>
        <p>Due to a need for low-stakes testing of avionics and control systems for future rocket projects, the Unmanned Controls/Avionics Test-Bed (UCAT) was
        designed to provide a simple testing vessel for avionic communication range and eventually control surface deflection dynamics.</p></div>

        <h3>January 2025 - Present</h3>
        <p>Alongside Gilbert Chang, the Polaris series of rockets powered by Loki Research's solid rocket motors was created with the intent of providing
         suborbital launch capabilities to investigate the possibility of high altitude rocket launches which may be able to support small payloads for more accessible microgravity research.</p></div>

        <h3>September - December 2023</h3>
        <p>In collaboration with Alayna Miller, Shreesh Nalatwad, and Nischal Suhas, a 72-page report was authored detailing a hypothetical Mars sample retrieval 
           mission based on mission parameter calculations done in MATLAB with the patched conics approximations.</p></div>
