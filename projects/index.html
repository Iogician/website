<h1>Jaden Hernandez's Project Portfolio</h1>
<p>Many of the skills I've gained, including SolidWorks, Siemens NX, Autodesk Inventor Professional, Ansys Fluent, 
   MATLAB, Simulink, XFLR5, Python, C, and Aras Innovator were acquired through coursework, but were also applied and honed
   during projects I've worked on.<br>
   Below is a list of the most significant projects I have been apart of:

<h2>Introduction to Aerospace Design: Mars Sample Retrieval (September - December 2023)</h2>
<img src="teamr403.jpg" alt="Northrop Grumman Space Award 2024 Presentation" class="image-right" width="320" height="213">
<p>As part of Purdue University's Introduction to Aerospace Design course, (course code "<a href="https://catalog.purdue.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=7&coid=50170" target="_blank">AAE 25100</a>") me and a group of three other students
   were tasked with designing a Mars sample retrieval mission involving selecting a viable launch vehicle and launch date
   while also calculating important astrodynamic mission parameters such as ΔV, mission duration, and stage masses.<br><br>
   During this project, I was largely in charge of writing all of these calculations in MATLAB and then communicating their mathematical basis in our 
   <a href="AAE251_Design_Report_R403.pdf" target="_blank">72-page report</a>.
   Me and my teammates' efforts won us the 
   <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/purdueaeroastro_presenting-the-space-award-winners-for-activity-7182024405550592000-wbmX?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web" target="_blank">Northrop Grumman Space Award in 2024</a>
   for having the most clearly communicated rocket design among all students in the Introduction to Aerospace Design course.<br><br>
   One key mission design choice that was unique to our solution, as highlighted by Northrop fellow <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE/engagement/iac/profiles/david-mcgrath">Dave McGrath</a>, 
   was our decision to entirely shed our Mars lander's entry, descent, and landing (EDL) gear upon ascending from the surface of Mars. This decision originated from the struggle to find
   a viable rocket engine to fit within our Mars ascent vehicle that would provide enough ΔV to ascend back to the orbiting vehicle. By shedding the EDL gear, we effectively
   reduced the weight of the Mars ascent vehicle which relaxed our criteria for possible engines to use in it.
