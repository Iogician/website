<h1>Premise</h1>
<p>
   As part of the Thermal Sciences (AAE 33800) curriculum at Purdue University,
   students are tasked with creating a project that will address a pressing
   thermal sciences issue.<br>
   With Anish Agarwal, Shreesh Nalatwad, Noah Smith, and Will Stupart,
   we chose to create an interface capable of estimating heat transfer for
   high altitude flight, particularly in the case of sounding rockets. This
   was especially pertinent due to the volume of rocketry teams at Purdue in addition to the growing popularity of collegiate rocketry across the nation.
