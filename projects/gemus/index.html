<h1>Hyun Research Program: GEMUS Flapping Wing Vehicle</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
   Under the advising of Dr. Nak-seung Patrick Hyun and alongside Jeffery Zhou and Gilbert Chang, a gliding-enabled, mode-switching, unmanned sensing (GEMUS) flapping wing vehicle 
   is being developed as a control system development platform to better understand how birds with large wings are able to conserve energy when faced with wind disturbances.
   The preliminary design has been partially validated through force transducer tests, with wind tunnel tests upcoming for further validation.<br><br>
   This page is still under construction. More information will be provided as the project progresses.
