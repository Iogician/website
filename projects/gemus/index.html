<h1>Hyun Research Program: GEMUS Flapping Wing Vehicle</h1>
<h2>Premise</h2>
<p>
   Under the advising of Dr. Nak-seung Patrick Hyun and alongside Jeffery Zhou and Gilbert Chang, a gliding-enabled, mode-switching, unmanned sensing (GEMUS) flapping wing vehicle 
   is being developed as a control system development platform to better understand how birds with large wings are able to conserve energy when faced with wind disturbances. This
   is of particular interest because flapping wing vehicles have not previously been experimentally proven to be capable of dynamic soaring via the Rayleigh cycle.
   The preliminary design has been partially validated through force transducer tests, with wind tunnel tests upcoming for further validation.
</p>
<h2>Development</h2>
<p>
   The current flapping wing vehicle prototype, denoted as version 0, has a wingspan of 0.98 m and a chord length of 0.186 m. The semi-elliptical wing was fabricated by using a printed template from a wide-format printer
   to guide a rotary fabric cutter through ripstop nylon fabric. The template, designed by me, is a CAD drawing with hidden edges visible to mark accurate carbon fiber spar placements for
   assembly of the wing. In the future, a new template will be utilized that has a span of 1.325 m and a chord length of 0.3 m.<br><br>
   Version 0's wings are driven by two ProModeler DS635BLHV servos whose rotations are transferred to the wing roots via an uneven four-bar linkage that effectively doubles the
   output angular velocity of each wing without the use of gears. For the next version, we intend to select a faster servo to enable higher flapping frequencies, but are still
   undergoing simulations in Ansys Fluent to estimate the torque required for one flapping cycle. The fuselage and wing-driving linkages are additively manufactured via
   fused deposition modeling with PLA filament.
</p>
<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<p>
   GEMUS is still early in the development phase, but has proven to be effective at wing flapping. In the most recent force transducer test for version 0, the robot was able to
   produce 515 grams of thrust and 180 grams of lift. With the robot weighing around 250 grams, the lift-to-weight ratio is less than 1. However, at non-zero angles of attack,
   GEMUS would, in theory, easily be capable of producing enough force to stay airborne because of the additional vertical contribution from the thrust vector.<br><br>
   After optimizing the wing flapping mechanism to maximize force production, the robot will undergo subsonic wind tunnel tests to better understand flapping performance in non-zero freestream velocity
   as well as gliding performance once we introduce artificial camber by tensioning our wing.
