<h1>Solid Rocket Motor Design and Analysis</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
   A custom solid rocket motor utilizing a three-point star port geometry is currently being mixed and prepared at Maurice J. Zucrow Laboratories for use in a model rocket
   that will launch in mid-November 2025 and allow us to validate the accuracy of our ballistics and trajectory simulations. The grain geometry, chosen for its high volume loading,
   was designed in SolidWorks and is estimated to be 4.6" x 1.212" in length and diameter respectively. From ballistics simulations, this H91 class motor is expected to produce
   around 258.70 Ns of impulse for a burn time of 2.79 seconds while still providing a 1.390 safety factor for maximum chamber pressure.<br><br>
   This page is still under construction. More information will be provided as the project progresses.
